Each time you fall you grit your teeth through the pain, let anger and grief power your muscles.  Let righteous indignation clear the brain fog so those who have wronged you can be taught a much-needed lesson.","\n","^You attempt to open your eyes. One is sealed shut. Your hand instincively explores the swolen socket. At first your pull back with the pain but push through. The skin is moist and tender and dried blood rims your brow.","\n","^It takes real effort to open the other one. Everything has a blurry film cast over it. A window betrays daylight and a curtain drifting in the breeze. The room is sparce, making details even harder. You scan to your right as you sit up and you swear you see movement. You stop and your heart clogs up your throat. You try to spring to your feet but your right leg and arm fail you. You grit your teeth and taste blood, forgetting for a second there may be someone or something in here with you.","\n","^The room looks vaguely familiar despite the lack of definition.

What little sleep you've gotten is done with one eye open. This image sees you poor, hungry, dirty, and alone. (VAGABOND)","\n","^One you can see a diaphenous drapery hanging about your shoulders, solidified and opaque where it needs to be. Some light jewelry sparkles on your wrists and ankles. You are muscular and scarred. You can feel the daring, the bravado that eminates from the image. Long luxurious hair that flows around you, emulating your own peerless grace. A court life leaves you laughing a lot, stayng up on recent gossip, and being ready for the next challenge of your considerable prowess. You immediately wonder what you would look like without all the magic that hangs on you, almost humming with power. You lack for nothing and take those scars voluntarily. (DUELIST)","\n","^One sees you with paler skin. You wear a brocade robe. Your black hair is up with silver pins keeping everything in its place. A confusion about you you really are. Your features, even blurry, are sterile. You can't read your expression.

Squinting through tears and dried blood you're not certain your features would be clear with perfect sight.

Behind that harlequin grin you can see the emptiness, though. You know its all an act.
